# Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. It is a zero-player game where the evolution of the game is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. The game consists of a grid of cells, each of which is either alive or dead. The state of the grid evolves in discrete steps according to a set of rules based on the number of live neighbors each cell has.

## Features

- **Simulates Conway's Game of Life** with customizable grid size and initial configuration.
- **Cellular automation**: The grid evolves based on its initial state and defined rules.
- **Interactive controls** to start, stop, and reset the simulation.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of the game's grid.

1. Clone the repository using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abbasmirza10/game-of-life.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd game-of-life
    ```

3. Install dependencies if applicable:

    ```bash

    ```

4. Run the simulation:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

- Use the buttons to **start**, **pause**, or **reset** the game.
- The game runs in a grid of cells, with each cell evolving based on its neighbors according to Conway
